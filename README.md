## Task One: Scraping and Analyzing Customer Reviews on Skytrax Website

- Description: In this task, I developed a web scraper to collect customer reviews from the Skytrax website for British Airways. The reviews were then pre-processed and analyzed to gain insights into customer sentiment and common themes. Using natural language processing techniques, I identified key areas of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction, helping to inform potential improvements in service.

### Key Steps:

- Developed a web scraper using BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to collect reviews.
- Pre-processed the text data (tokenization, stopword removal, POS tagging,lemmatization).
- Performed sentiment analysis using VADER to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Visualized the most common words and phrases using word clouds and frequency distributions.
- Extracted actionable insights from the sentiment and thematic analysis.

## Task Two: Predictive Modeling of Customer Behavior (Booking)

- Description: In this task, I built predictive models to forecast customer booking behavior based on various features in a provided dataset. The goal was to understand factors influencing bookings and predict future booking patterns. The insights from this analysis can help British Airways optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

### Key Steps:

- Explored and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values, duplicates and encoding categorical variables.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify significant features and patterns.
- Built and evaluated different machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random - forests) to predict customer booking behavior.
- Fine-tuned model hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
- Interpreted the model results to provide actionable recommendations for marketing and operational strategies.
